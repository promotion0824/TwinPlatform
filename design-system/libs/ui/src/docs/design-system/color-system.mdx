# Color System

Our color system is designed to enable a consistent product experience.

## Overview

Color is applied to our UI through the use of color tokens, which reference color values made available through the core palette.

See all available color tokens on the Color Tokens page. This documentation will help understand the systems behind these tokens.

### Naming

Our color tokens do not follow a rigid naming structure, but all share common elements within their names:

- **Group** - top level objects that group colors according to their usage.
- **Property** - indicates the property a color is be applied to.
- **Variant** - can appear at any level, and some variants are shared across groups.
- **State** - some token sets have common user interaction states built in.

### Groups

Top level groups give structure to our color tokens:

- `neutral` - desaturated colors for generic ui styling.
- `intent` - colors with semantic names that indicate their intended usage.
- `core` - access to all named colors (`red`, `blue` etc) from the core palette for creative usage that has no meaning.
- `state` - groups state related colors that are shared across multiple components.
- `data` - sets of colors designed specifically for datavizualization.

### Properties

Every color token (besides those in the `data` group) contain one of the following property variants:

- `bg` - background colors.
- `fg` - text and icon colors.
- `border` - borders.

These variants can appear at any level within a tokenâ€™s name.

### States

Some tokens have the common interaction state of `default`, `hovered` and `activated` built in.

States that involve consistent styling across many components are stored as top level groups.

To read more about common states please see the States guidelines pages.

## Neutral group

Neutral colors should be used for generic application UI styling.

## Intent group

Intent colors should be used for user actions (buttons, links), application feedback (validation, notifications), and application or data state (badges, selection indicators).

<img src="./color-system-intent-group.png" alt="color system intent group" />

- `primary` - actions or feedback of high importance.
- `secondary` - actions of less importance.
- `negative` - actions or feedback that is negative, dangerous or destructive.
- `positive` - feedback that is positive, safe or productive.
- `notice` - feedback that is neither negative or positive such as warnings.

## Core group

Core colors are for creative usage when there is no meaning attached to the application of colour.
