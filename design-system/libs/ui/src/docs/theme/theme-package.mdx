# Theme package

The `@willowinc/theme` package provides APIs to theme applications and style components.

## Theme provider

`ThemeProvider`, which extends StyledComponents [theme provider](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced), is used to provide the `theme` object to all descendant components in a tree.

### Usage

We recommend wrapping your application at the root level:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@willowinc/theme'

const appEntry = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

## Theme object and design tokens

The `theme` object provided by the the `ThemeProvider` contains our design tokens.

Design tokens are styling variables stored in semantically named key/value pairs. Our tokens provide styles for colors, typography, spacing, shadows and z-index.

Token documentation can be found on the following pages:

- [Global Tokens](?path=/docs/theme-global-tokens--docs)
- [Base Tokens](?path=/docs/theme-base-tokens--docs)
- [Theme Tokens](?path=/docs/theme-theme-tokens--docs)
