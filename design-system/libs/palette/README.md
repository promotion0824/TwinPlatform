# Palette

This library exports palettes for both a dark and light theme based on lightness values using [@adobe/leonardo-contrast-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/leonardo-contrast-colors). For more details, please refer to our [documentation](https://storybook.willowinc.com/).

If changes are made to the palette's config, it can be built with the command `npx nx build`.
